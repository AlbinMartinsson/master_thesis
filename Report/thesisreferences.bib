   abstract = {The paper presents a survey and analysis on the current status and concerns of Internet of things (IoT) security. The IoT framework aspires to connect anyone with anything at anywhere. IoT typically has a three layers architecture consisting of Perception, Network, and Application layers. A number of security principles should be enforced at each layer to achieve a secure IoT realization. The future of IoT framework can only be ensured if the security issues associated with it are addressed and resolved. Many researchers have attempted to address the security concerns specific to IoT layers and devices by implementing corresponding countermeasures. This paper presents an overview of security principles, technological and security challenges, proposed countermeasures, and the future directions for securing the IoT.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) consists of smart devices that communicate with each other. It enables these devices to collect and exchange data. Besides, IoT has now a wide range of life applications such as industry, transportation, logistics, healthcare, smart environment, as well as personal, social gaming robot, and city information. Smart devices can have wired or wireless connection. As far as the wireless IoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication technologies and protocols can be used to connect the smart device such as Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field Communication (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. This paper will be an attempt to review different communication protocols in IoT. In addition, it will compare between commonly IoT communication protocols, with an emphasis on the main features and behaviors of various metrics of power consumption security spreading data rate, and other features. This comparison aims at presenting guidelines for the researchers to be able to select the right protocol for different applications.},

As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development.

   abstract = {The standard and real-time communication technology is an unalloyed inevitability for the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is a challenging and daunting task for any organisation because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. Copious messaging protocols have been developed and employed by various organisations based on their requirements in the last two decades. Though, none of them is able to support all messaging requirements of all types of IoT systems. Messaging protocol is an ongoing dilemma for the IoT industry; consequently, it is important to understand the pros and cons of the widely accepted and emerging messaging protocols for IoT systems to determine their best-fit scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the four established messaging protocols MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP for IoT systems. Firstly, it presents the broad comparison among these messaging protocols to introduce their characteristics comparatively. Afterwards, it performs a further in-depth and relative analysis based on some interrelated criteria to gain insight into their strengths and limitations. Thus, based on this detailed evaluation, the user can decide their appropriate usage in various IoT systems according to their requirements and suitability.},

IoT devices helps to connect all sensors which help to monitor and control electronic or mechanical systems.

To make the device modular we need to find a best way of communication protocol so that the latency of the communication will be less.

Smart factory is a production solution in a flexible and efficient way should be to meet the needs of today's market, and achieves integration between the various industrial and non-industrial partners who build dynamic, and very often and virtual organizations. This type of integration, linking the physical components of the production system and digital, abstract, virtual components into a single system called cyber-physical production systems. Systems are the backbone for the smart factory. Cyber-physical systems of production will be structured so that they can respond to almost any change in the market in time within really smart factories, but also beyond its borders. This not only makes production faster and in accordance with the specific requirements of individual customers, but also allows to production processes within the company are optimized through a network of global cooperation, adaptive and evolutionary and self-organizing.

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly spreading, reaching a multitude of different domains, including personal health care, environmental monitoring, home automation, smart mobility, and Industry 4.0. As a consequence, more and more IoT devices are being deployed in a variety of public and private environments, progressively becoming common objects of everyday life. It is hence apparent that, in such a scenario, cybersecurity becomes critical to avoid threats like leakage of sensible information, denial of service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized network access, and so on. Unfortunately, many low-end IoT commercial products do not usually support strong security mechanisms, and can hence be target of - or even means for - a number of security attacks. The aim of this article is to provide a broad overview of the security risks in the IoT sector and to discuss some possible counteractions. To this end, after a general introduction to security in the IoT domain, we discuss the specific security mechanisms adopted by the most popular IoT communication protocols. Then, we report and analyze some of the attacks against real IoT devices reported in the literature, in order to point out the current security weaknesses of commercial IoT solutions and remark the importance of considering security as an integral part in the design of IoT systems. We conclude this article with a reasoned comparison of the considered IoT technologies with respect to a set of qualifying security attributes, namely integrity, anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, access control, authentication, authorization, resilience, self organization.},

In 2014, China’s State Council unveiled their ten-year national plan, Made-in-China 2025, which was designed to transform China from the world’s workshop into a world manufacturing power. Made-in-China 2025 is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade China’s industry including the manufacturing sector. In Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025, many applications require a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of Industry 4.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines including cyber-physical Systems, IoT, cloud computing, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Architecture, SOA, Business Process Management, Industrial Information Integration and others. At this present moment, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major obstacle for exploiting the full potential of Industry 4.0. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for realising Industry 4.0, which poses unique challenges.

This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed.
