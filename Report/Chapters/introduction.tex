% Chapter 1: Introduction

\section{Background}
The number of devices connected to the Internet has risen from 7 billions in 2018 to an estimated 35 billions in 2021 according to Security Today and that number is only going to increase.[1] %https://securitytoday.com/Articles/2020/01/13/The-IoT-Rundown-for-2020.aspx?Page=2%. 

% Suggestion:
You might want to look at ARTEMIS's Embedded Intelligence: Trends and Challenges.
More specifically at Chapter 2: Challenges for Europe.

\section{Motivation}
With the numbers of devices connected to the Internet, IOT-devices from now on, rising to an estimated 38.6 billion devices world wide by 2025 the need to enable communication between those devices have never been bigger.

\section{Problem definition}
This project aims to investigate the possibilities, benefits and limitations of using Eclipse Arrowhead framework with embedded devices in local clouds.
The Arrowhead framework is in contrast to commercially available solutions such as Amazons Amazon Web Services, AWS from now on, and Microsofts Azure.  
The way to measure the difference between either using a central broker, the MQTT protocol used by AWS and Azure or using peer to peer, HTTP protocol used by the Arrowhead framework to handle the communication between devices in terms of latency, energy consumption and security. % this is a long sentence: try to break it up if possible.

\section{Equality and ethics}
Equality and ethics are learning objectives for the program and should be reflected upon in the thesis if applicable. This section can be omitted if not at all relevant to the problem definition, but in many cases the thesis topic touches upon these topics even if it is outside the scope of the work itself and in such cases a single paragraph may be sufficient to cover the reflection.

\section{Sustainability}
Similar to the equality and ethics section this is one of the learning objectives for the program and should be reflected upon in the thesis if applicable. For a quick overview of what is considered to be included in sustainability you can see the united nations list of sustainability goals: https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/

\section{Delimitations}
Describe what is not covered in the thesis. Things you realize may have to be addressed to create a complete solution, but that would be too much work, or that may simply be out of the scope of your scientific area.

\section{Thesis structure}
Describe how the rest of your thesis is organized. (e.g. In section 2 we discuss, in section 3 there is a... etc.). This is really just to help guide the reader to where different parts of your work can be found.
