%Intro to intro
The use of IoT-devices in large scale industries is a fairly new and intresting area of research. 
This thesis will take a look at the opportunity and possibility to connect your embedded IoT-devices to a local arrowhead framework cloud.
This project will use the STM32 B-L4S5I-IOT01A IoT discovery node as development board, running the Mbed-OS 6. 

\section{Background}
%What is there now?
The Arrowhead framework contains a lot of examples in an array of different languages and technologies mainly java, the language the framework is developed in. 
Python, C\# and C++ have client libraries and example code developed for them, which can be found on the projects github page\cite{Github2021} 
%What is needed?
However, there is no client library or code example for a specific piece of hardware with the intention of making the connection to a local arrowhead cloud fast and easy. 
This thesis will examine the possibilities of having a ready made example for to compile and run that enables connection to a local arrowhead cloud as a proof of concept. 
Much like the 'Hello world' examples from Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. 

\section{Motivation}
With the numbers of devices connected to the Internet, IOT-devices from now on, rising to an estimated 38.6 billion devices world wide by 2025 the need to enable communication between those devices have never been bigger.

\section{Problem definition}
%This is good, if deleting the other paragraph expand this.
This project aims to investigate the possibilities, benefits and limitations of using Eclipse Arrowhead framework on embedded devices in contrast to commercially available solutions such
as Amazons Amazon Web Services and Microsofts Azure. 
%Maybe remove, how to measure?? 
The way to measure the difference between either 
using a central broker, the MQTT protocol used by AWS and Azure or using peer to peer, 
HTTP protocol used by the Arrowhead framework to handle the communication between devices in terms of latency, 
energy consumption and
security.
\section{Equality and ethics}
The ability to own and control your data are becoming more and more rare these days with giant corporations establishing their own cloud services.
You as a consumer always takes a risk when pushing sensitive data the a cloud owned by someone else, the right to own your data should not have to be infringed upon. 
The arrowhead framework and the use of local clouds moves the storage of your personal data from giant corporations to your own. 
\section{Sustainability}
The use of small embeded devices instead of monolithic machines used by the industry today provides a much needed decrease in energy consumption for larger industries.
The use of IoT-devices would also in greater scale enable preventive maintinence of components, reducing both the cost and materials required for maintinence later on.
\section{Delimitations}
\subsection{Security}
%Expand
This thesis will not cover a solution to the numerous secruity risks and issues associated with IoT-devices. 
\subsection{Core systems}
%Expand
This thesis will also only cover the three core systems of the Eclipse Arrowhead framework, which are the service registry, authorization and orchestrator. 
The STM32 B-L4S5I-IOT01A IoT discovery node will not host the Arrowhead framework on the board itself, due to the fact that the Arrowhead framework is to resource heavy for such a small device.
The board will instead connect to a local Arrowhead cloud hosted by another computer in the same network. 
\subsection{Intracloud connection}
%Expand
It will also only cover connection within the same local arrowhead cloud, intracloud, as opposed to using multiple clouds, intercloud.
Intercloud connection requires two more Arrowhead systems, gateway and gatekeeper, in order to operate and the configuration of those systems is beyond the scope of this thesis.
\section{Thesis structure}
In chapter 2 related work is presented, a literature review of IoT, Industry 4.0, security and the Eclipse Arrowhead framework is conducted. 

In chapter 3 theory is covered, describing what scientific methods where used in this thesis. 

Chapter 4 covers implementation, describing how the different systems used in this thesis uses are designed from a software engineering perspective.

In chapter 5 an evalution of the experimet conducted will be performed. 

Chapter 7 presents the conclusion of the work done in this thesis. The chapter also describes how to further investigate the questions raised in this thesis. 

In chapter 8  there is a list of references used in this thesis.
