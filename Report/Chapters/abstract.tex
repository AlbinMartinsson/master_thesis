The abstract is a mini thesis on its own. It should contain the briefest of motivation and problem description, what has been done, and summarize the results. The purpose is to give the reader a quick view of the content, and encourage the reader to read the rest of the thesis. It's also helpful to put the reader in the right frame of mind for the rest of the thesis. This section is typically anything between one paragraph for short research papers (of 8 pages) to a page for a full thesis
