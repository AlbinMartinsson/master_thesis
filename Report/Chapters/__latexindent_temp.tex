Hello Jan,
I have been working on the demo today and it turned out to be very difficult to get it to run. I am on the final steps which requires you to create an amazon bucket to 
store the update. The demo itself is used to  introduce OTA (over the air) update. So yesterday when i thought I just had to generate a certificate was an under statement. 
Today I have managed to build the demo and 
launch it on the board but I still have to configure the AWS iot console in order to see what is being sent back and forth. I will do this tomorrow.
