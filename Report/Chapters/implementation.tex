\section{Implementation}
This is not a step-by-step instruction or diary to your work. Instead, you should describe your technical approach and solution, describe architecture, components, etc. Think software engineering... Perhaps use a few useful uml-diagrams or illustrate the system architecture. Keep in mind that the purpose of the implementation section is to describe your implementation to solve the problems from 1.3.
