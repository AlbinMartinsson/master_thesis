\section{References}
This section should be easy if you always write down your references the moment you read them / use them. There are, however, several acceptable ways of writing references. There are plenty of instructions online to help you get these correct. The typical format is:
[1] Authors separated by comma, "Title in cursive and within citation marks", Place of publication, (for articles you also add issue, number, and pages as well), date.  
\\ \\ 
instead of [x] you can also use [First Author (, et. al), year]
